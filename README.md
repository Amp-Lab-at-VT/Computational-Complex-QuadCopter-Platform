# Computational-Complex-QuadCopter-Platform
The goal of this project is to design and build a working QuadCopter platform, that will be upgraded as part of a different project in the future to house a number of autonomous features. We plan on using a + orientation to simplify the programming needed to create it to fly, and plan to use a 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer as the main sensors.
